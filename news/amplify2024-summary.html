      In September 2024, we debuted <b>Amplify</b> at <b>The University of Manchester</b>, a one-day event for Black undergraduate physicists across the UK. Our new annual programme from The Blackett Lab Family, led by Yolanda Ohene and Mark Richards, aims to connect Black undergraduates in physics across the UK with each other, academics and industry professionals to show <b>we exist.</b>
    </p>
    <p class="subtext">
      Underrepresentation across UK Physics departments creates significant challenges for Black students navigating one of the most academically demanding degrees. On registering to Amplify students scored <b>1.8/5</b> to the question “how connected to other physicists do you feel”. We developed this event to create a unique networking opportunity for students along with highlighting that a physics degree provides a solid foundation for diverse and rewarding career paths.
    </p>
    <p class="subtext">
      <b>Amplify 2024</b> marked our first in-person event in the north of the UK, with participants coming from Newcastle to Southampton. Altogether, we welcomed ~30 students and speakers to connect, showcase our work, and celebrate our voices as Black physicists!  
    </p>
    <p class="subtext">
      We kicked off with an icebreaker for everyone to get to know each other. Our opening session, <b>“Shall I do a PhD”</b>, was hosted by Sara Habte, who first began with an informative presentation demystifying the PhD process and research careers. Next, students heard personal experiences from a panel of Black physicists including
      <a href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/osullivans" target="_blank" style="color: #FF6700;">Sam O'Sullivan</a>, 
      <a href="https://sophmrtn.github.io/" target="_blank" style="color: #ff6700;">Dr Sophie Martin</a>, 
      <a href="https://www.forwomeninscience.com/article/101" target="_blank" style="color: #FF6700;">Dr Ann Njeri</a> and 
      <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/lionel-london" target="_blank" style="color: #FF6700;">Dr Lionel London</a>. From hunting black holes to conference trips to Seoul, the speakers shared valuable insights for navigating an academic career which was followed by an engaging Q&A session.    </p>
    <p class="subtext">
      Next, we unpacked <b>“Being Black in Physics”</b>, a session developed by Dr Estifa'a Zaid and Tolu. Students imagined their physics superheroes, and reflected on their own unique strengths as physicists - qualities worth celebrating and sharing with confidence.
      Our <b>“Careers as Physicists”</b> session featured <a style="color: #FF6700;" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAACTz6MBW9LYLJZ8QzfgEAanxX1v5w4QGDA" target="_blank">Dr Kwasi Kwakwa</a> (Wellcome Sanger Institute), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAIxpPYBnEs_84ZE_UJWYCEe7HBC8Z5V8ug" target="_blank" style="color: #FF6700;">Dr Youmna Mouhamad (Nyfasi)</a> and 
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAWvgI4B6X9vQzIG1ippsaogviXnQRLTGLY" target="_blank" style="color: #FF6700;">Dr Emmanuel Kwame Bempong-Manful</a> (University of Manchester). Each speaker showed us their distinctive career paths, highlighting the many turns a physics career can lead.
    </p>
    <p class="subtext">
      <b>Dr Marcus Newton</b> (Associate Professor at University of Southampton) wrapped up the day with an inspiring keynote on his groundbreaking work in imaging nanoscale quantum materials, developing advanced materials for energy harvesting and taking technologies to a global level.
    </p>
    <p class="subtext">
      The event created a powerful space for <b>connection and recognition</b>, understanding each other in our differences with physics being the thread weaving everyone together. And how can we forget the delicious Ghanaian inspired lunch including jollof and plantain - big up RJ Cuisine.       
    </p>
    <p class="subtext"> Thank you to the Physics Department at the University of Manchester for supporting the event. And let's keep amplifying our voice in the world of physics!
