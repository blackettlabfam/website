      <p class="subtext">We are thrilled to announce the <b>first-ever</b> symposium for <b>Black</b> and <b>mixed-Black</b> undergraduate physics students in the UK! </p>
        <p class="subtext">
          An important mission for us is to <b>connect</b> and <b>support</b> Black physicists across the UK, and we thought it’s time to bring the undergrads together to link up!
          We know that doing a physics degree can be tough, so we wanted to create space to <b>build connections</b>, <b>explore</b> what it means to be #BlackInPhysics and <b>feel empowered</b> to take your next steps.

        WHAT, WHERE & WHEN? 
      </h3>

    <p class="maintext">
      Amplify 2024 will be a free, one-day, in-person event hosted by us at The University of Manchester on <span class="orange-text"><b>Thursday 12th September 2024</b></span>. 
    </p>

    <p class="subtext">
      The day will be a blend of <b>interactive sessions</b> to chat about the latest physics research and <b>career discussions</b> to discover the many paths open to students post-graduation. There will be plenty of space and time to reflect on yourselves as <b>next-generation Black physicists</b> in the UK, and as always we will be bringing the vibes and <b>nyaming on Afro-Caribbean</b> food.

        <p class="subtext">
          Meet other UK-based Black <b>undergrad students, graduates, PhD students</b> and <b>academics</b> with careers both within and outside of academia. 
          This will be a unique opportunity to make connections and discover the diversity in physics throughout the day.

      <p class="subtext">
        We recognise the fact that people of Black-heritage are severely <b>underrepresented</b> amongst those studying and working in physics and physics-related fields: our mission is to change that! Therefore, we encourage you to apply if you are:

          <li>An undergraduate physics student in the UK of Black or mixed-Black heritage 
          </li>
          <li>
            Going into 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th (Scotland) year of a physics degree at a UK university
